# Is an 1100 bad at chess?

As a beginner in chess, understanding what your rating means and where it stands among other players can be confusing. With an average opponent rating of 1000 plus, the question is raised whether an 1100 chess rating is a bad one or not. In this article, we will delve deeper into what chess ratings are, interpret what an 1100 rating means, and how to improve your chess skills.

## Understanding Chess Ratings

### Calculation of Chess Ratings
A chess rating is a numerical value assigned to a player based on their performance in rated games. The most commonly used rating system is the Elo system, which was devised by Arpad Elo. In this system, each player begins with a rating of 1000 and every rated game played either results in points gained or lost. The rating calculation takes into account the player's performance as well as their opponent's rating.

### Interpretation of Chess Ratings
A chess rating indicates the player's skill level compared to others. The higher the rating, the more skilled they are. For example, a player rated 2000 is considered an expert while a player rated 3000 is considered a grandmaster. A player rated 1000 is a beginner while a player rated 1500 is considered an intermediate player.

### Above Average Opponent Rating
A chess rating of 1100 means that the player is above the average opponent rating.
