# Is 70 Accuracy Good in Chess?
As a competitive game, accuracy is a vital aspect of chess as players aim to make the best possible moves to gain an advantage over their opponents. However, what is considered good accuracy in chess and how do players achieve it? In this article, we will discuss and analyze the various factors that contribute to accuracy in chess and how players can improve their accuracy to become better players.

## What is Accuracy in Chess?
Defining accuracy in chess can be challenging due to the inherent complexity of the game. In general, accuracy in chess is measured by how well a player's moves align with the current best moves recommended by computer analysis. While it is impossible to play perfectly in chess, accuracy signifies how close a player is to the ideal moves suggested by the computer analysis.

## What is a Good Accuracy Percentage in Chess?
Personal opinions and experiences vary widely, with some chess players considering 70% accuracy a good performance, while others aim for 90%+. Expert analysis also indicates that accuracy above 90% is generally an indicator of a good game. In general, the longer a game goes and the more complicated the position, the harder it is to maintain high accuracy levels.

Factors that contribute to accuracy in chess include preparation and knowledge, ability to calculate and visualize variations, and intuition and decision-making skills. Preparation and knowledge refer to the player's understanding of opening, middlegame, and endgame principles that guide their choices. The ability to calculate and visualize variations is crucial in determining the best moves and avoiding blunders. Intuition and decision-making skills refer to a player's ability to make the best move, even in unfamiliar or complex positions.

## How to Improve Accuracy in Chess?

To improve accuracy in chess, players need to practice and study. Here, consistency is key, as frequent practice helps to develop the necessary skills to become a better player. Analyzing and learning from mistakes help players to identify areas of weakness and improve their decision-making skills. Playing against stronger opponents also helps to improve accuracy by exposing players to higher-level play and forcing them to make better moves.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, chess accuracy is a critical aspect of the game that measures how closely a player's moves align with the current best moves recommended by computers. While personal opinions on good accuracy may vary, expert analysis indicates that accuracy above 90% is generally an indicator of a good game. To improve accuracy, players need to practice and study, analyze and learn from mistakes, and play against stronger opponents.
