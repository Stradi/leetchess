# Islamic Perspective on Board Games

Islamic jurisprudence holds that all activities are permissible except those deemed haram, or prohibited, by Allah. In Islam, games that promote gambling, wasting of time, or cause harm to oneself or others, are considered haram. Intellectual games that promote knowledge or skills, on the other hand, are permissible.

## Understanding the Concept of Haram in Islam

The Quran prohibits activities that promote behavior against the moral values of Islam, including gambling. The Prophet Muhammad also stated that gambling is an abomination and its users will be punished. The concept of haram encompasses not only actions that are explicitly prohibited in the Quran, but also those that lead to prohibited actions or harm. 

## Chess as a Form of Gambling

Chess has been considered a form of gambling throughout Islamic history. Some Islamic scholars suggest that the game encourages the players to gamble by creating the possibility of winning or losing. The chance element involved in the game is considered a type of gambling. The historical roots of chess also contribute to its association with gambling.

## Chess as a Waste of Time

Religious teachings emphasize the efficient use of time and discourage wasting it. Chess may be seen as a tool for distraction from religious duties or other productive activities. However, some argue that chess helps develop mental skills and provides social interaction.

## Saudi Arabia's Grand Mufti's Ruling on Chess

Saudi Arabia's grand mufti issued a fatwa banning chess, asserting that it is a waste of time and encourages gambling. Many Islamic scholars and chess enthusiasts criticized the ruling, saying that it ignores the intellectual and social benefits of the game. The ruling also caused debate on the permissibility of intellectual games in Islam.

## Islamic Stance on Intellectual Games

Intellectual games such as chess, provided they do not promote gambling or wasting time, are permitted in Islam. They are believed to develop cognitive abilities and provide a platform for healthy social interaction. Other intellectual games, such as backgammon, are also allowed provided they adhere to the principles of Islam.

## Conclusion on the Permissibility of Playing Chess in Islam

In conclusion, the permissibility of playing chess in Islam remains a topic of debate. While some view it as a form of gambling and a waste of time, others see it as an intellectual game that provides significant cognitive benefits. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide whether chess promotes behaviors or activities that go against their religious beliefs.
