Aggressive openings are characterized by moves that focus on controlling the center of the board, putting pressure on the opponent's pieces, and creating opportunities for attack.

### 3. Analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each opening

Each of the four openings has its strengths and weaknesses. The Smith-Morra Gambit offers a quick attack that can put your opponent on the defensive early in the game, but it requires precise play to maintain its advantage. The Bird's Opening can also surprise your opponent, but it can lead to a weakened pawn structure if not played carefully. The Vienna Opening offers flexibility and control of the center, but it requires a solid understanding of positional play to be effective. The Italian Game provides the potential for expansive play, but it can also leave your king exposed if not played carefully.

### 4. Discussion of common tactics used in each opening

Each of the four openings has its own set of tactics that can be used to gain an advantage. The Smith-Morra Gambit often involves advancing the d pawn to create a strong central pawn structure. The Bird's Opening often involves attacking on the f file and centralizing the queen. The Vienna Opening often involves knight maneuvers to control the center of the board.

Understanding potential variations can help you plan ahead and maintain the advantage.
